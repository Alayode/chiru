Learning a new Framework can be frustrating especially when you have so many tutorials and sample code out there.
For me the best way to learn a new language or code is to grab a lintless piece of code and break it down to small bits and build it back up again
. Time is short and you can waste a huge amount of time trying to read an entire book on Rails or JavaScript it is best to study by putting together
a piece of code line by line until it becomes apart of your DNA. Many people who try to learn a new skill or perfect an old come to term with this rather
quickly. For instance I have this repo here of an old project that is written in JavaScript using the Angular JS Framework.

My goal is to try and explain as much as possible in simple terms on how the major parts of an angular Project can work.
